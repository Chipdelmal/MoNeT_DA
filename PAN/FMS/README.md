# pgSIT & Femaless

These scripts run the pipelines for the datasets generated by [Ifegenia & pgSIT MGDrivE simulations](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGDrivE/tree/master/Main/pgSIT_Femaless).

## Drive Codes

One-node analysis of pgSIT efficacy as compared to other sterile insect techniques. Drive codes are:

* `PGS`: pgSIT
* `FML`: Femaless

## Experimental Setup

The experiments' filename key is `E_ren_rer_...` with:

* `ren (1e0, 2)`: number of releases
* `rer (1e3, 4)`: size of the releases

## Data Paths

Base directories for output and analysis:

* Data: `/RAID0/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/`
* Analysis: `/RAID5/marshallShare/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/`

With the symlinked paths being:

* `/RAID5/marshallShare/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/ANALYZED` to `/RAID0/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/ANALYZED`
* `/RAID5/marshallShare/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/TRACE` to `/RAID0/fem_pgSIT/{drive}/TRACE`
